# v0.102.0
> [!IMPORTANT]
> LLM integration was removed due to the complexity of maintaining this feature. For more information, see [#8797](https://github.com/orgs/TriliumNext/discussions/8797). This means that the database needs migration (downgrades will not be possible without restoring from backup), but it will not affect the sync with the server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enjoyed this release, consider showing a token of appreciation by:
> 
> *   Pressing the “Star” button on [GitHub](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium) (top-right).

## 💡 Key highlights

*   Trilium now has support for **custom icon packs** that can be used for note icons. See [Icon Packs - User Guide](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/concepts/themes/icon-packs) for more info and a list of [official icon packs](https://triliumnotes.org/en/resources).
*   New layout now provides a save indicator near the note title.
*   Trilium now uses its own PDF renderer (based on PDF.js viewer from Mozilla). This allows for more features such as annotations, search (within the current file), filling forms as well as remembering last reading position. See [documentation](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/note-types/file/pdf) for more info.
*   Some Collections will hide their children in the note tree by default. See [the documentation](https://docs.triliumnotes.org/user-guide/concepts/ui/note-tree/hiding-subtree) for details.
*   **jQuery has been updated to v4.0.0 which introduces breaking changes that could potentially affect your scripts.**
*   Desktop app: background effects (Vibrancy) are now available for macOS.

## 📱 Mobile improvements

*   Collections now show the “Collection properties” toolbar, allowing to switch views and configure the collection.
*   The tab row was removed in favor of a more browser-like tab switcher, displayed as a modal with note preview.
*   The title row was significantly changed:
    *   The note icon is now displayed with the possibility of changing the icon.
    *   Inherited from the new layout on desktop: the note badges (read-only, shared), save indicator.
    *   Icons should now be easier to press.
    *   The inline title for text and code notes from new layout is now available.
*   The note actions menu (right of note title):
    *   All the features that are available on the desktop on the new layout are now available, allowing features such as search, toggling share/template/bookmark, changing note type/editability and even import/export/print.
    *   Some components from the status bar were also relocated here for mobile: backlinks, note paths, attachments, note info, similar notes and text/code language switchers.
    *   Custom note actions (note-specific) were also ported, with buttons such as “Run active note”, “Toggle read-only”, “Upload new revision”.
